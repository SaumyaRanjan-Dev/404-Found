## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It forms the backbone of any website, defining the structure and layout of a web page.

### HTML Structure

HTML documents are divided into two main sections:

1. **`<head>`**: Contains metadata about the webpage, such as the title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts.
2. **`<body>`**: Contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and more.

### Sample HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my first web page</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
